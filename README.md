# Small Local Storage Project 🦄

Live Demo 💥: https://astonishing-churros-f1bd4c.netlify.app/

Hi Guys!! 👋

I want to show you a web development project that I have carried out, with the purpose of those who want to practice these topics on their own.

## In this project the tools I used were:

```
1️⃣ JavaScript
2️⃣ HTML
3️⃣ CSS
```

# Purpose with which I did it: 🌟

## `To practice topics like: `

```
1️⃣ localStorage
2️⃣ JSON
3️⃣ for...in loop
4️⃣ addEventListener()
5️⃣ if and else conditionals
6️⃣ Arrays
7️⃣ JSON.parse
8️⃣ Submit
9️⃣ innerHTML
🔟 JSON.strigify()
1️⃣1️⃣ setItem()-getItem()-removeItem()-clear()
1️⃣2️⃣ Callback Funtion()
```

## Feel free to do them if you want to improve even more in programming and if you are a beginner, these exercises will be very helpful. 💯

# A little advice for you:

## I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves.

# Prettier definition

## `Prettier` offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What `Prettier` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.
